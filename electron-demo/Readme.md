Why did you choose this subject?

I chose this subject because I think applying our knowledge of HTML / CSS / Javascript to another medium is a great way to expand the utility of our skills. While I dont use desktop based apps as much anymore, its great to be able to be able to work in an area like the desktop that has different use cases and value.

How were you first made aware of it?

I heard about electron in passing but only really knew what it was today.

What problem does it solve?
Electron allows a developr to apply web based programming skils to a building a desktop app.  Additionally, Electron apps can be used across a variety of different operating systems including Mac, Windows, and Linux.  This allows a developer to build their app once and have to ready to deploy broadly.


How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
Electron handles the idosyncracies in the different operating systems and takes care of packaging, installation, and updates so that the developer can focus on the app more than the configuration with different operating systems. 


What are the alternatives?
Im not really aware of alternatives.  

What is the history of this technology?
Electron began in 2013 as the framework on which Atom, GitHub's hackable text editor, would be built. The two were open sourced in the Spring of 2014. Github and an active community of contributors continue to maintain it.


What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
Its great technology that allows you to utilize pre-existing skills in a new way. Have access to eveything local in you laptop opens up a whole new arena of files / data to play with.

What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
Understanding the archtecture of the main process and the renderer process is important. Understanding defining global variables for windows and how each window is compartmentalized is different.  Its a bit challenging to pin down the differentiation between the JS and CSS that we already know, and create a distinct understanding of Electron syntax and function.  


What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
Docs from electronjs.org as well as youtube tutorials. 

What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?
1. What other frameworks / languages would you use with electron in addition to HTML / CSS / JS?
2. Explain the Architecture of Electron and the basic function
3. How could Electron be used with our primary product


Also, please include the instructions necessary to:

install node.js
npm init
-make sure that the start script in your package.json file is assigned to "electron ."
npm install electron
npm start


Run your example.
Do I need to run bower install? Do I need an API key?
Use your subject.

Do I need to include it in my HTML with <script> tags? Do I need to brew install anything? Can I deploy it to Heroku?
